# Social Video Manager

A local, interactive social media video asset manager built with React and Electron. This application allows you to manage multiple directories containing video files, view metadata, and play videos directly within the app.

This project is under active development and many planned features are still a work in progress.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm (v8+)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-video-manager.git
   cd social-video-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Development:
   ```
   npm run dev     # Start Vite development server
   npm run electron # Start Electron app
   ```

   Or run both concurrently (if you're not using Windows PowerShell):
   ```
   npm run electron:dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run electron:build
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Adding Directories
1. Click the folder icon in the sidebar
2. Navigate to a directory containing video files
3. Select the directory and click "Open"

### Viewing Videos
- Videos will appear in the main view area
- Use the search box to filter videos by name
- Click column headers to sort by name or date

### Playing Videos
- Click on a video card to open the video player
- Use the standard video controls for playback
- If in-app playback fails, use the "Open in Default Player" button

### Managing Directories
- Go to settings to manage directories
- Remove directories you no longer need with the trash icon

## Troubleshooting

### Video Playback Issues
- Ensure you have the necessary codecs installed for your video formats
- Try opening the video in your system's default player
- Check file permissions to ensure the app can read the video files

### Application Crashes
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify you have the latest version of the application
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Video Playback**: ReactPlayer
- **Desktop Integration**: Electron
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Electron Builder

### Architecture
The application uses a layered architecture:
