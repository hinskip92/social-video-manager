## Usage Guide

### Adding Directories
1. Click the folder icon in the sidebar
2. Navigate to a directory containing video files
3. Select the directory and click "Open"

### Viewing Videos
- Videos will appear in the main view area
- Use the search box to filter videos by name
- Click column headers to sort by name or date

### Playing Videos
- Click on a video card to open the video player
- Use the standard video controls for playback
- If in-app playback fails, use the "Open in Default Player" button

### Managing Directories
- Go to settings to manage directories
- Remove directories you no longer need with the trash icon

## Troubleshooting

### Video Playback Issues
- Ensure you have the necessary codecs installed for your video formats
- Try opening the video in your system's default player
- Check file permissions to ensure the app can read the video files

### Application Crashes
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify you have the latest version of the application
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Video Playback**: ReactPlayer
- **Desktop Integration**: Electron
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Electron Builder

### Architecture
The application uses a layered architecture:
- **UI Layer**: React components and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **File System Access**: Electron's IPC for communication with Node.js
- **Video Handling**: ReactPlayer for playback, with fallback to system default

## Python Utilities

### Smart Auto-Crop Script

This repository includes a standalone Python script located at
`scripts/smart_vertical_crop.py` that converts 16:9 landscape videos into
9:16 vertical clips. It uses **PySceneDetect** to split each input video into
scenes and **YOLOv8** to detect people so the crop can follow the primary
subject.

Below is a quick tutorial for running the script.

### Tutorial

1. **Install the dependencies** and make sure `ffmpeg` is available on your
   system path:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare the directories.** Create the following folders next to the
   repository (or specify them with CLI options):

   ```text
   input_videos/    # put your 16:9 source videos here
   output_videos/   # final vertical videos will be written here
   temp_scenes/     # scenes detected by PySceneDetect
   temp_frames/     # frames extracted for YOLO analysis
   cropped_scenes/  # cropped scene files before concatenation
   ```

3. **Add your footage** to `input_videos/`. Any `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, or `.avi`
   file will be processed.

4. **Run the script**. The example below uses the defaults but you can add any
   of the optional flags:

   ```bash
   python scripts/smart_vertical_crop.py \
       --frames-per-scene 5 \
       --box-strategy largest
   ```

   Use `--help` to see all available options, including how to pick the best
   subject box strategy, scale the final output, or overwrite existing files.

5. **Review the results.** Cropped vertical scenes are concatenated into a
   single output video saved in `output_videos/` with `_vertical` appended to the
   original filename.
